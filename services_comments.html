## Nov 2025
- **Accommodation & Food Services**: "Suppliers are very inconsistent on how they are planning and executing pricing related to tariffs. Overall uncertainty on how to source and how much to source is as high as during the coronavirus pandemic era."
- **Construction**: "Residential home sales continue to be hampered by mortgage rates. Most of the industry is describing their slowdown as an intentional pause, while suppliers and labor are looking at cutting margins. To maintain build volume, subcontractors are tightening their belts."
- **Finance & Insurance**: "Increased activity due to year end project push."
- **Health Care & Social Assistance**: "Patient volumes appear to be leveling off a bit, providing teams a chance to catch their breath. Supply chains are operating surprisingly well, as measured by notably higher back-order and fill-rate performance. Labor remains a strong performer as well; staffing levels remain high and there is less demand for travel labor altogether. Cost of goods remains higher but there are pockets of softening beginning to appear. Forecast remains optimistic."
- **Information**: "Business still slow due to tariffs."
- **Management of Companies & Support Services**: "With the end of the federal government shutdown, we have resumed normal operations. However, we are cautious that there may be another shutdown at the end of January."
- **Real Estate, Rental & Leasing**: "Tariff uncertainty continues to add complexity to purchasing, and economic conditions remain mixed, with some indicators pointing to good prospects and others to worrying ones."
- **Retail Trade**: "Business continues to be strong, driven by customer traffic. Pricing stable."
- **Utilities**: "Business is ramping down for the end of the year — an overall great year."
- **Wholesale Trade**: "We are anticipating demand to be consistent with what we have seen in 2025 thus far. Affordability continues to be a problem for an entire generation of buyers. We expect margins to erode as competitors fight for business. Lumber production is set to be reduced significantly, so prices should increase in 2026."

## Oct 2025
- **Finance & Insurance**: "Activity is generally flat month-over-month; we are closely monitoring effects of the new tariff announcement."
- **Management of Companies & Support Services**: "Uncertainty due to the federal government shutdown has shuttered many non-essential functions. This will lead to project delays and likely hurt our overall fiscal year 2026 expectations. Our sites are funded through the next couple of months, but if the shutdown continues beyond that time, we will expect mass furloughs of our employees."
- **Mining**: "Relatively flat activity levels for oil and gas."
- **Professional, Scientific & Technical Services**: "Client demand for advisory and compliance services remains solid, particularly as businesses navigate evolving tax legislation and increased regulatory scrutiny. However, we are seeing extended approval cycles on discretionary projects and tighter controls on consulting spend, which is putting pressure on procurement to be more agile and cost-efficient."
- **Public Administration**: "Heightened business activity due to new fiscal year budget. Items made with or utilizing precious metals are up, basic labor is down — though maintaining employees has been more difficult since a return-to-office order was implemented."
- **Real Estate, Rental & Leasing**: "The overall economy continues to provide mixed signals, which makes it difficult to determine how to move forward as a business given the uncertainty."
- **Retail Trade**: "Business very strong, no supply chain or logistical issues."
- **Transportation & Warehousing**: "General business has been steady, with minimum fluctuation."
- **Utilities**: "Tariffs continue to cause disruption in contracts and contracting, driving up pricing on goods, particularly engineered and manufactured equipment. The backlog of existing orders with delays continues to persist for equipment and manufactured equipment."

## Sep 2025
- **Accommodation & Food Services**: "We are beginning to see the impact of the tariffs impact our business, particularly for food products from India, China, and Southeast Asia, coffee from South America, and apparel and electronics from Asia. Our year-over-year cost increases are getting progressively greater."
- **Construction**: "New residential construction continues to struggle in a tough market. Housing values remain high, and tariffs are beginning to be passed through on materials that are metal based. The pace of housing starts has been stagnant to slightly declining, as we head out of the summer building season."
- **Health Care & Social Assistance**: "Pharmacy costs continue to rise, and medical devices are being held at bay mainly due to contracts and continued negotiations where we have two to three sources for a given product."
- **Information**: "Demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud infrastructure remains very strong. Our primary focus this month was on increasing production throughput to begin clearing the significant order backlog built up over the summer. While new order intake has stabilized at a high level, the overall business outlook remains positive. We are still facing significant supply chain challenges, especially for advanced semiconductors and power components, with lead times remaining extended. Price pressures are still present but have not worsened compared to the previous month."
- **Professional, Scientific & Technical Services**: "Client demand in professional services remains steady, though decision-making timelines are lengthening due to continued economic uncertainty and interest-rate concerns. We are also seeing modest upward pressure on labor costs, which impacts both our internal resourcing and supplier pricing."
- **Public Administration**: "Growing apprehension regarding state efforts to reduce or eliminate property taxes that are a major revenue source for local governments. And continuing concern about future economic conditions, inflation, tariffs and their impact on increased prices."
- **Real Estate, Rental & Leasing**: "The overall housing market remains stagnant, which has forced our company to be hyper-vigilant about costs. However, we are growing and increasing our market share despite the headwinds. Tariffs continue to inject an unnecessary level of uncertainty across the broader economy, and costs are now beginning to increase with the full effect of the tariffs now coming into play."
- **Retail Trade**: "Costs overall have stabilized, and we've not seen any interruptions in sourcing or shipments."
- **Utilities**: "We've had more tariff charges last month than in previous months."
- **Wholesale Trade**: "Business conditions continue to soften, even in markets that have historically been more resilient. Demand is simply weak."

## Aug 2025
- **Accommodation & Food Services**: "We are starting to see the impact of tariffs on the cost of imported goods. For our company, this is primarily for goods from Asia and South America. We expect to see the full effect of tariffs in our cost of goods sold by October."
- **Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing & Hunting**: "Tariffs are starting to become a factor in our pricing to specific markets. We are an importer from Europe. The intention is not to pass on these costs, but it's getting harder as this goes on."
- **Finance & Insurance**: "Tariffs continue to loom, and providers are starting to include references to tariffs when requesting price increases."
- **Management of Companies & Support Services**: "While our overall spending approach is to remain cautious while waiting out the effects of the new tariff policies on commodity pricing, we expect fiscal year 2026 to be positive."
- **Other Services**: "Business continues to remain flat."
- **Professional, Scientific & Technical Services**: "Business growth continues to be strong as companies work to understand costs of expanding U.S. operations."
- **Public Administration**: "Locally, prices have and are continuing to rise on goods and services that do not appear to be directly impacted by tariffs."
- **Real Estate, Rental & Leasing**: "Our company had the strongest quarter in its history since it became a public company in 2020. Revenue is increasing due to M&A activity and in spite of a slow housing market and increasing tariffs."
- **Retail Trade**: "It's all about country specific tariff management. All decision making is currently dominated by tariff considerations."
- **Transportation & Warehousing**: "Business overall is tightening. Most customers are extremely price conscious."

## Jul 2025
- **Accommodation & Food Services**: "Anticipation of the final tariff impacts is resulting in delayed planning for next fiscal year purchases."
- **Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing & Hunting**: "Higher tariffs are increasing the cost of imported feed ingredients and trace minerals for livestock and poultry feeds. Business and customer concerns over additional cost risk due to additional tariffs."
- **Construction**: "Trade uncertainty causing client reevaluation of feasibility for projects in certain sectors, resulting in some delays or cancellations. Public-funded jobs experiencing pullbacks."
- **Educational Services**: "Summer break for students greatly reduces demand on campus."
- **Finance & Insurance**: "Steady business activity."
- **Health Care & Social Assistance**: "Tariffs are causing additional costs as we continue to purchase equipment and supplies. Though we need to continue with these purchases, the cost is significant enough that we are postponing other projects to accommodate these cost changes."
- **Mining**: "Extra purchasing to head off tariffs has leveled off. Expecting decreases in activity in the second half of 2025."
- **Real Estate, Rental & Leasing**: "Economic uncertainty remains the dominant theme. However, the tariff talk has turned out to be much more bluster than actual policy, and businesses have seemed to tune out the noise. The outlook continues to look incrementally positive."
- **Retail Trade**: "Retail results are solid — a little soft before and during Fourth of July week, but then a rebound. We see no reason to believe this won't continue for the near term."
- **Transportation & Warehousing**: "Our business activity is flat. We are not trending up or down. Tariffs are now starting to show up in pricing, and we are seeing increases across the board."

## Jun 2025
- **Accommodation & Food Services**: "Restaurant sales and traffic remain flat to prior year. Staffing is adequate for our current needs, and no supply chain concerns this month."
- **Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing & Hunting**: "Increased cost from tariffs and the potential for tariffs is impacting cost increases. Higher cost of high-dollar items like 150-horsepower farm tractors are forcing farmers to delay purchasing or purchase used equipment. Tension in the Middle East is creating great concern and uncertainty."
- **Construction**: "Sales remain stubbornly slow due to affordability issues with higher mortgage rates and high property values. Residential construction has embarked on cost-cutting measures through value engineering, supplier margin reductions and layoffs."
- **Health Care & Social Assistance**: "Prices have gone up from tariff recovery fees — separate line items — but the supply chain, deliveries and inventories have remained mostly stable after the initial disruption. Costs continue to increase across the board, so our goal is to mitigate that."
- **Information**: "General uncertainty around the economy continues to drive increases in prices. Also, lots of SaaS (software-as-a-service) vendors are using the AI (artificial intelligence) boom to restructure pricing and products, resulting in massive increases."
- **Other Services**: "After several slow months, business is starting to increase. New requests are going out to suppliers."
- **Professional, Scientific & Technical Services**: "Confidence in a predictable economic environment has eroded to a point where capital investments are being severely curtailed."
- **Real Estate, Rental & Leasing**: "Business growth is slow. Global economic conditions impacted by U.S. tariffs are creating significant uncertainty, which is holding businesses back from making short- to medium-term business decisions."
- **Utilities**: "Lead times are extending in the past month or two. Seeing high-single- or low-double-digit percent increases in pricing on metals related to commodity hardware and products."
- **Wholesale Trade**: "Business seems to be picking up. Many of the macroeconomic factors that were concerning look to be playing out in our favor. High interest rates are still a problem. Supplies are ample for current business levels."

## May 2025
- **Construction**: "Tariff variability has thrown residential construction supply chains into chaos. Many items are still manufactured in southeast Asia, and suppliers are beginning to test the waters for increases. Major heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment manufacturers are passing on their cost increases due to higher refrigerant and steel commodity prices. Planning is difficult for community projects that could be scheduled for the next 22 to 30 months."
- **Finance & Insurance**: "Steady, with some signs of growth and opportunity."
- **Health Care & Social Assistance**: "Federal budget cuts are affecting purchasing decisions."
- **Information**: "Tariffs remain a challenge, as it is not clear what duties apply. The best plan is still to delay decisions to purchase where possible."
- **Mining**: "Due to the tariffs, we've had had small price increases on our international raw materials, and some suppliers are holding back inventory to cover uncertainties. We've seen some slowdown in the production of new wells, but there has been an increase in restimulation of existing wells."
- **Professional, Scientific & Technical Services**: "Life science startups continue to push forward on clinical trials and market launches. The level of investment grew this month. The impacts of tariffs are being watched but are not driving changes in strategic plans."
- **Public Administration**: "The projects are slowly starting to be issued, albeit with a great deal of market uncertainty."
- **Retail Trade**: "Business is strong. Consumer concerns over tariffs may be driving some demand."
- **Transportation & Warehousing**: "Tariffs have increased the cost of doing business. It's too early to tell what the lasting impact of this will be. We have tried to budget for the increase, but it has been a moving target. Overall, we are seeing a leveling off in business activity; time will tell if this is temporary or long lasting."

## Apr 2025
- **Accommodation & Food Services**: "Sales and traffic have improved on track with year-over-year seasonal trends. We seem to be outperforming some of the publicly traded restaurants reporting results."
- **Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing & Hunting**: "Tariffs are negatively impacting small business customers. Many small business customers source their products from China. They cannot afford to compete in the marketplace sourcing from other countries. We could not move products fast enough to beat the tariff starting dates."
- **Construction**: "Business is steady."
- **Educational Services**: "There is great concern at my institution (medical school with a research institute and hospital) that changes from the current administration will severely and adversely affect many of the populations we are trying to help live healthier lives."
- **Health Care & Social Assistance**: "We are actively reviewing the impact of tariffs. We are seeing some vendors increasing their prices, and we are actively pushing back on those increases. We expect our vendors to honor our contracted pricing."
- **Other Services**: "Generally, pricing is lower, but there is some uncertainty of actual, final costs due to tariffs."
- **Public Administration**: "Our business is in a state of crises with uncertainty caused by both the ongoing trade war and the threats to federal funding of programs."
- **Real Estate, Rental & Leasing**: "Uncertainty remains the dominating theme as the U.S. government has been maddeningly inconsistent with tariff implementation."
- **Transportation & Warehousing**: "Tariffs and concerns about government grants still impacting our procurement operations. Some projects are slowing or being held off to ensure we have funds to complete the current work."
- **Utilities**: "The tariff uncertainty is causing a lot of consumption of human capital. We are starting to see some tariff charges, some are significant given the price of the highly specialized units that were ordered over two years ago. Based on our spend over the last couple of years, we will have to adjust our capital and operations and maintenance plans."

## Mar 2025
- **Accommodation & Food Services**: "Restaurant sales and traffic have improved in the past month overall. Valentine's Day typically starts an improved seasonal trend that was consistent this year. We remain optimistic about the coming months, despite recent news of possible recession and tariffs that have not played out yet."
- **Construction**: "Starting to see effect of aluminum tariff. These costs will be passed on to customers."
- **Health Care & Social Assistance**: "Patient volumes continue to exceed forecast, leading to increased revenues and an improved financial outlook. Supply chains continue to operate effectively and few categories — including IV solutions — are showing signs of duress. Labor outlook is improving, with reliance on travel staff continuing to recede. Outlook for the duration of the quarter is favorable."
- **Information**: "The tariffs have caused issues in the groundwood paper market especially. With a large amount of groundwood imported from Canada to the U.S., the tariffs and resulting delays have caused havoc with the supply chain and deliveries. U.S. mills are getting backlogged and late from the additional tonnage they've taken on."
- **Other Services**: "New equipment purchases have slowed down over the last month due to the uncertainty of the new administration and cancellation of certain aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act."
- **Professional, Scientific & Technical Services**: "We are seeing some loosening in the U.S. economy related to hiring and people retention. Quality candidates are available, and employee turnover is decreasing. Competitive pressure for goods and services is increasing as suppliers seek organic increases in revenue."
- **Public Administration**: "Government budget cuts and layoffs are negatively impacting our operations."
- **Transportation & Warehousing**: "We are still holding back some money for emergency use in case the new administration targets grant usage and puts a hold on current spending."
- **Utilities**: "We're expecting price increases in the near future due to tariffs on several commodity-based contracts, including waterworks items."
- **Wholesale Trade**: "Tariff confusion and the variety of ways that suppliers are responding have had a strong effect on our purchasing decisions this month, causing us to shift spend and in some cases buy in advance of reported tariffs."
